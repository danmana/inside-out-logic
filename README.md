#Create your own inside-out cubes from paper  

Inspired by youtube video [Inside-Out Logic by George Hart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzxWXEbSRE)

##What you need
1. Paper  
2. Printer  
3. Scissors or cutter
4. Glue or tape

##How to
1. Download one of the provided PDFs (I used [two by two - black](Inside out logic (two by two - black\).pdf?raw=true))  
2. Print both shapes  
3. You should have 8 pieces of each shape  
4. Cut them out (leave a bit of extra paper on some of the edges for sticking them together)  (TODO: upload some pictures)
5. For each shape, fold 4 pieces printed-side-out, and the other 4 printed-side-in (this gives us symmetry we need)  
6. Glue each piece  
7. For each shape glue 8 pieces together to form one of the cubes

#Tips and Tricks
* If you use thick paper and your printer can't print on it, print a template on a regular piece of paper, cut it out, and use a pencil to trace around this template.
* If you line them up by hand you can fit all the needed pieces on 4 pieces of A4 paper
* You can generate your own PDFs by printing the html page (size and alignment can be adjusted)
* There are light gray versions of all PDFs, in case you want then printed lines to be less visible
